Agentic-U3-A-Multimodal-AI-Agent-for-Context-Aware-Conversational-Interaction

Agentic U3, a robust microservice based conversational AI framework which support real time interactions across multiple modalities, integrates user shared documents for contextual knowledge base, providing dynamic emotionally attuned responses. 

A modular, microservice-based AI system designed to handle real-time speech transcription, natural language processing, dialogue orchestration, and multimodal interaction. Built to scale and deploy with Docker & CI/CD.

## Tech Stack

- **Backend:** FastAPI • Uvicorn • Python
- **Models:** OpenAI Whisper • Faster-Whisper
- **Speech:** ElevenLabs • gTTS
- **Memory:** Redis • FAISS
- **Audio:** PyDub • ffmpeg
- **DevOps:** Docker • GitHub Actions
- **Frontend (Optional):** React + Tailwind

## CI/CD Pipeline

> Uses **GitHub Actions** to automate:

- Code formatting, linting
- Build & test pipeline
- Docker image creation
- Health check endpoints
- Optional: Deploy to cloud or VPS

## How to Run (Locally with Docker)

```bash
# Build all services
docker compose build

# Run a specific service
docker compose up stt

# Or run everything
docker compose up
```
